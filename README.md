In this video, he uses **Python.** I tried to convert this project to C language. The main theme is the same, creating a slot machine game. Since Python and C has some different approachs, I had to change _so many things,_ actually.

Thanks to _Tech With Tim_, who is the owner of video.

It was a good opportunity for me to remember and practise C basics.
